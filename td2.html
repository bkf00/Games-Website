 <br>
    <br>
    <p> Tom Clancy's The Division 2 was released on the 15th of March 2019 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, 
      Microsoft Windows and Google Stadia by Massive Entertainment a studio owned by Ubisoft. </p>
    <p> The events of Tom Clancy's The Division 2 take place during the summer of Washington, D.C., 7 
      months after the events of the Dollar Flu, which took place in the winter in New York City. The virus has now spread to Washington, D.C. </p>
    <p> Washington, D.C. has been recreated to be as authentic as possible complete with well-known 
      landmarks and buildings. Despite the possible controversy, Ubisoft has stated that the choice of 
      location was not one of politics despite the fact the chosen location is the nation's capital. </p>
    <p> The team behind The Division 2 made the game with the community in mind, they repaired everything 
      that was bad from the first game and made this one, the definitive version of The Division series. </p>

    <p class="title2"> Plot </p>
    <p> Seven months after the Green Poison outbreak, several Strategic Homeland Division (SHD) agents are defending 
      a civilian settlement from a bandit attack when the SHD Network, the system controlling their advanced technology and 
      communications, suddenly shuts down and they receive a Division distress call from Washington, D.C. The playerâ€™s agent 
      makes their way to the city where The Division and the remains of the local Joint Task Force have set up their Base of 
      Operations in The White House. After defeating an attack on the White House shortly after arriving in the city, the agent
       is briefed on the general situation by Manny Ortega, The Division controller for D.C. The agent learns that much of the 
       city is under the control of three main enemy factions: the Hyenas, a loosely organized group of several gangs, criminals,
        and anarchists who seek to take advantage of the chaos, the Outcasts, a fanatical group made up of the survivors of the 
        Roosevelt Island quarantine zone, whom seek to exact revenge on those they believe responsible for their imprisonment and 
        eventual infection, and the True Sons, a highly organized and ruthless group of former Joint Task Force personnel, paramilitaries, 
        and other traitors who seek to gain control over the entire capital. Ortega instructs the agent to work with fellow agent Alani Kelso
         to help assist civilian settlements, fight the various enemy groups, and restore the SHD Network. </p>
