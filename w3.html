 <h class="title1"> The Witcher 3:Wild Hunt </h>
 <br>

 <p> The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was released on 19th May 2015 on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, later
to be brought by Saber Interactive to Nintendo Switch, the first time any game from the Witcher franchise to be ported on a Nintendo console. </p>
 <p> Unlike the previous games, The Witcher 3 is set in a multi-region open world, featuring over 100 hours of content. </p>
 <p> Every choice you make in the game is important as the consequences of Geralt's actions will impact how the narrative
progresses, there are multiple endings that depend on your choices.</p>
 <br>
 <p> The world is in chaos. The air is thick with tension and the smoke of burnt villages. The fearsome Empire of Nilfgaard 
has struck again, ravaging the helpless Northern Kingdoms. The once mighty who tried to use Geralt for their own gain are now gone.
In these uncertain times, no one can say what fortune holds in store, who will bring peace to the world and who will cause it only
misery. But a force darker and deadlier emerges. </p>
 <p> The petty men and women commanding tin-plated armies fail to understand that their conflict is child's play compared to
the Wild Hunt, the otherworldly threat which now looms. These ghastly spectral riders have for ages plagued humankind, bringing misery
to the world. This time the Wild Hunt seeks one person in particular: the one individual Destiny itself bestowed upon Geralt, the one
soul Geralt considers kin. </p>

 <br>
 <p class="title2"> General </p>
 <p> This is the grand finale to Geralt's story, while the game can be played even without knowing what happened in the first and
second installments, you get an option at the beginning of the game where it asks you if you played The Witcher 2, depending on what you
choose some dialog lines will be changed to not spoil anything from the previous game. <p>
 <p> You are not forced to play the quests in a certain order, you can progress however you like, the only thing that makes it 
difficult is the level system, some quests being higher level. But that does not stop you from playing a level 20 quest at level 5. </p>
 <p> The world of Witcher has a unique atmosphere, memorable characters and a gritty dialogue, there is no wonder why it became such a huge success </p>
 <br>
 <p class="title2"> Inside the world of Witcher 3 </p>
 <p> The open world of this game has been extended 35 times comparted to Witcher 2, it inhabits a vast world with multiple ecosystems
and cultures that players are free to move between at will and multiple regions that have deep cultural references. </p>
 <p> The exploration is fully free and it is not spoiled by loading times. </p>
 <p> As mentioned before, the world is shaped by the player's decisions, it has a realistic day and night cycle blessed with a dynamic
weather system, giving each gameplay a unique feel. </p>
 <p> There is an in-game economy system, the price of goods vary because of the surrounding conditions, for example the price of fish
can differ very much depending on the distance from the water to the merchant. </p>

 <br>
 <p class="title2"> Combat </p>
 <p> The combat in the game is based on a variety of actions, you are given 2 swords, a steel one that is used against humans or wolves
and a silver sword that is used against monsters. You can attack, dodge, use potions, use specific oils on the blades for higer damage against beings and use magic. 
 <br>
 <p class="title2"> Alchemy </p>
 <p> During the gameplay, you will find different recipes for substances, potions, oils, decoctions and bombs that you can craft with 
ingredients that you can either find by yourself or buy. 
 <p> There are multiple types of potions, some can heal you, can make you more powerful or even grant you better sight in darker places,
of course, there are many more to be found! </p>
 <p> Like potions, there is also a big number of oils for every kind of monster, granting extra damage to them in battle. </p>
 <p> There are a lot of useful things you can craft with alchemy. </p>

 <br>
 <p class="title2"> A game inside a game </p>
 <p> There is a card game called Gwent, you are given at the beginning of the game a quest in which you have to become the best card
player by defeating different oponents to take their unique cards. </p>
 <p> There are 4 decks in total (with a 5th added via the DLC), some cards can only be used by specific decks like the Nilfgaardian 
Empire, the Monsters, the Northern Realms and the Scoia'tael decks, there are also neutral cards that can be placed in any deck.
 <p> In Gwent there are 3 lanes, close combat, ranged combat and siege combat with all cards having their own lane that can be placed 
only on that specific one. </p>
 <p> To win the card match you have to win 2 rounds but you have to be careful that the 10 cards you begin the game with are all you 
will have unless you use the Northern Realms deck which gives you the special ability when you win a round to draw a card from the deck or the
spy card. Using all your cards in the first round means certain defeat! Plan your moves carefully. </p>
 <p> Here is an example of a simple Gwent match: </p>

 <p class="title2"> Creatures </p>
 <p> Throughout the game, you will find a lot of Witcher Contracts that require you to slay different kinds of monsters that are 
plaguing the people, either villagers or royal guards, as long as they have the coin to pay the witcher. </p>
 <p> The monsters are all categorized by their type, there can be Beasts, Cursed Ones, Draconids, Elementa, Hybrids, Insectoids,
Necrophages, Ogroids, Relicts, Specters and Vampires, all types having multiple subspecies. As you progress in the game you will find books
about different creatures that by reading them will add that certain monster in your Bestiary where you can read about it and find its weakness
, you can also add details in the Bestiary of monsters by defeating them. </p>
